# Astro Starter

Hi! 👋
This is my first project with AstroBuild.
I've been trying to find time to try it for a long time.
Let's get started.

## Integrations

Here are some integrations that I'm going to use in this project:

- [x] Tailwind CSS https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── blog
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── about.astro
│       └── design-elements.astro
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
